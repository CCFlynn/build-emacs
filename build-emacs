# At this point the original script loaded my .bashrc, rsynced the emacs-builds/ directory to my
# high-bandwidth mirror and then my local server (sending growl notifications each time) and then adjusted the
# permissions such that the http daemon could write to the directory (my original site had reddit style thumbs
# up/down voting on each build and votes were stored in the build dir). I've redacted this part because it had
# a lot of server, user and directory names.
